PROLOGUE
GILGAMESH KING IN URUK
I WILL proclaim to the world the deeds of Gilgamesh. This was the man to whom all things
were known; this was the king who knew the countries of the world. He was wise, he saw
mysteries and knew secret things, he brought us a tale of the days before the flood. He went on a
long journey, was weary, worn-out with labour, returning he rested, he engraved on a stone the
whole story.
When the gods created Gilgamesh they gave him a perfect body. Shamash the glorious sun
endowed him with beauty, Adad the god of the storm endowed him with courage, the great gods
made his beauty perfect, surpassing all others, terrifying like a great wild bull. Two thirds they
made him god and one third man.
In Uruk he built walls, a great rampart, and the temple of blessed Eanna for the god of the
firmament Anu, and for Ishtar the goddess of love. Look at it still today: the outer wall where the
cornice runs, it shines with the brilliance of copper; and the inner wall, it has no equal. Touch the
threshold, it is ancient. Approach Eanna the dwelling of Ishtar, our lady of love and war, the like
of which no latter-day king, no man alive can equal. Climb upon the wall of Uruk; walk along it,
I say; regard the foundation terrace and examine the masonry: is it not burnt brick and good? The
seven sages laid the foundations.
